LitGene is an under-development python script for automated gene annotation and search of the PubMed database for articles relating a 
set of genes to a given term.


**Example:**

The script takes a gene-set (eg. BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, TP63) and a co-term (eg. Breast Cancer) and returns a CSV file containing detailed 
annotation about every gene of the list (based on NCBI Gene db) and the pubmed publications which relate each gene to the given co-term.

The script is currently developing so stay tuned for further updates!
